## Fishery-Dependent Data
Fishery removals were divided among two fleets: 1) North and 2) South. Landings for the North fleet are defined as fish landed in Washington and Oregon ports. Landings for the South feet are defined as fish landed in California ports. The landings of Petrale sole are made primarily by groundfish bottom trawl gear; landings by gear types other than bottom trawl have been inconsequential, averaging less than 2.5% of the coast-wide landings. The non-trawl landings (that consist of only a small fraction of the total landings) are included along with the trawl landings in a single gears fleets.
