## Fishery-Dependent Data
Fishery removals were divided among two fleets: 1) North and 2) South. Landings for the North fleet are defined as fish landed in Washington and Oregon ports. Landings for the South feet are defined as fish landed in California ports. The landings of Petrale sole are made primarily by groundfish bottom trawl gear; landings by gear types other than bottom trawl have been inconsequential, averaging less than 2.5% of the coast-wide landings. The non-trawl landings (that consist of only a small fraction of the total landings) are included along with the trawl landings in a single gears fleets.

### Commercial Fishery Landings
All landings for this assessment were summarized by state (based on port of landing). Landings for Washington and Oregon are summed into a single North fleet (consistent with previous assessment) due to the fact that vessels commonly fish and land in each other's waters and ports.

#### Recent Landings
Recent commercial landings of petrale sole (1981-2022 for California and Washington; 1987-2022 for Oregon) were obtained from the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN), a regional fisheries database that manages fishery-dependent information in cooperation with west coast state agencies and NOAA Fisheries (www.pacfin.com). Catch data were extracted by state and then combined into the fishing fleets used in the assessment. Time series of recent (PacFIN era) landings by state are shown in *Figure XX. 

#### Historical Landings
Historical landings of petrale sole were reconstructed by state, by year. The Washington historical landings (1938 -1980) were obtained from Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, who recently conducted historical catch reconstruction for petrale sole (pers. comm. T. Tsou and G. Lippert, WDFW). The historical Oregon landings (1932-1986) were obtained from Oregon historical catch reconstruction, conducted by Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in collaboration with NWFSC (*Karnowski et al. 2014). The California historical landings were informed by several sources. The most recent “historical” period (between 1969 and 1980) were available from the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CalCOM) database. Earlier landing records (between 1931 and 1968) were reconstructed by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (*Ralston et al. 2010). *Ralston et al. (2010) included only California landings made in California ports, therefore *Ralston et al. (2010) estimates were supplemented by catches landed in California ports, but made in waters of Oregon and Washington, provided by the SWFSC (pers. comm. E.J. Dick, SWFSC). The earliest California landings were obtained from California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) Fish Bulletins for 1916-1930 landings (Heimann and Carlisle 1970) as reconstructed by Lai et al. (2005) and used in previous assessments (REF HERE). The California fishery began in 1876, but no landings data are available from 1876-1915. Therefore, consistent with previous Petrale sole assessments, a linear interpolation between landings of 1 ton in 1876 and the landings recorded for 1916 are used to filling this period.

### Discard
Data on discards of Petrale sole are available from two different data sources. In 2002, the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) was implemented on the West Coast of the United States, which began with gathering bycatch and discard information for the limited entry trawl and fixed gear fleets. Observer coverage has expanded to include the California halibut trawl, the nearshore fixed gear and pink shrimp trawl fisheries. Since 2011, trawl fisheries have been managed with catch shares under a system of annual individual fishing quotas (IFQs) for the shoreside sector (i.e., vessels delivering to shoreside processors) and harvest cooperatives for the at-sea hake sectors (catcher-processors who catch and process hake at sea; and Motherships, factory processors that take delivery of hake from catcher vessels at sea). A 100 percent at-sea monitoring of catch using observers and electronic monitoring (EM) is required to participate in the trawl catch share fishery.

The historical source (often referred to as the Pikitch data) comes from a study organized by Ellen Pikitch that collected trawl discards from 1985-1987 (*Pikitch et al. 1988). The northern and southern boundaries of the study were 48∘42′ N latitude and 42∘60′ N latitude respectively, which is primarily within the Columbia INPFC area (Pikitch et al. 1988, Rogers and Pikitch 1992). Therefore, this source of discard data is only relevant to North fleet. Participation in the study was voluntary and included vessels using bottom, midwater, and shrimp trawl gears. Observers of normal fishing operations on commercial vessels collected the data, estimated the total weight of the catch by tow, and recorded the weight of species retained and discarded in the sample. Results of the Pikitch data were obtained from NWFSC (pers. comm. John Wallace, NWFSC). 

### Fishery Length and Age Data

The fishery length and age data for North fleet were obtained from PacFIN BDS database and contained data from Oregon and Washington. For South fleet length and age data were obtained from PacFIN BDS database and from the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CalCOM), the latter were provided by CDFG (pers.comm. Brenda Erwin, CDFG).

In previous assessments, it was identifies that some of the Oregon petrale sole samples collected prior to 1987 represent samples that were collected for special projects (pers. comm. Ali Whitman, ODFW). For this assessment, Oregon length and age samples were thorough evaluated and non-standard Oregon historical samples were filtered out and not used to generate length and age compositions. 

Commercial length-frequency distributions based on the fishing year were developed for each state for which observations were available. For each fleet, the raw observations (compiled from the PacFIN and CalCOM databases) were expanded to the trip level, to account for the relative size of the landing from which the sample was obtained. The expanded length observations were then expanded by the landings in each state for the combined Washington and Oregon fleet. Age frequencies were computed in the same manner, except that age observations for Washington and Oregon were not combined due to ageing error considerations. The length and age composition expansion was conducted using PacFIN.Utilities function publicly available via GitHUB.

Length and age data collected from commercial landings for each fleet are summarized by the number of trips and fish sampled by year (Tables 11 and 12). Figures 33, 34, and 35 show plots of the commercial length and age composition data across time for each fishery fleet.

The input sample sizes for length and age frequency distributions by year were calculated as a function of the number of trips and number of fish via the Stewart Method (Stewart, IPHC, pers.comm.). The method is based on analysis of the input and model derived effective sample sizes from west coast groundfish stock assessments. A piece-wise linear regression was used to estimate the increase in effective sample size per sample based on fish-per-sample and the maximum effective sample size for large numbers of individual fish.

Discard length composition data for both fleets were available from WCGOP and for North fleet from Pikitch study as well. WCGOP length composition data were not sex specific WCGOP raw observations were expanded the haul level, to account for differences in catch among hauls. Pikitch data (although available by sex) was very limited (32 fish sampled for length), and was included in the assessment for females and males combined. No age data were available for discarded fish.

### Discard Mean Body Weight

WCGOP also provided estimates of discard mean body weight, and these data were used in this assessment for each fishing fleets. The mean body weight of discarded fish are shown in Figures 29 - 32.
