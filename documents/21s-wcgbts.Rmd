### \acrlong{s-wcgbt}

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design;
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011].
This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast.
Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October.
This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} commonly encounters `r spp` along the U.S West Coast, except south of Point Conception (Figure XX). The catch-per-unit-effort estimated from the survey is roughly constant north of 38$^\circ$. The survey does fish shallower than 54 m and the encounter rate of `r spp` declines at waters deeper than 400 m. Figure XX shows that the positive tows catch rate by depth peaks between 100-200 meters and declines as depth increases. The observed lengths captured across depths by the survey are shown in Figure XX.

Geostatistical models of biomass density were fit to survey data using Template ModelBuilder (TMB) (*Kristensen et al. 2016) via the R package Species Distribution Models with (sdmTMB) (Anderson et al. 2022). These models can account for latent spatial factors with a constant spatial Gaussian random field and spatiotemporal deviations to evolve as a random walk Guassian random field (Thorson et al. 2015). Tweedie, delta-binomial, delta-gamma, and mixture distributions, which allow for extreme catch events, were investigated. Results are shown only for the distribution that led to the best model diagnostics, e.g., similar distributions of theoretical normal quantiles and model quantiles, high precision, lack of extreme predictions that are incompatible with the life history, and low Akaike information criterion (AIC). Indices from this best model were predicted using a grid based on available survey locations. Code to reproduce the analysis is available at https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/indexwc.

The data were truncated to depths less than 675 m prior to modelling given that there were zero positive encounters in depths deeper than 675 m. The prediction grid was also truncated to only include available survey locations in depths between 55â€“675 m to limit extrapolating beyond the data and edge effects.

The model used a delta model with a lognormal distribution for the catch-rate component, as it was shown that lognormal distribution is able to better account for extreme catch events, which was observed in case of petrale in 2014 and 2021 surveys. A logit-link was used for encounter probability and a log-link for positive catch rates. The response variable was catch (mt) with an offset of area (km2) to account for differences in effort. Fixed effects were estimated for each year. The following additional covariates were included: pass. Vessel-year effects, which have traditionally been included in index standardization for this survey, were not included as the estimated variance for the random effect was close to zero. Vessel-year effects were more prominent when models did not include spatial effects and were included for each unique combination of vessel and year in the data to account for the random selection of commercial vessels used during sampling (*Helser, Punt, and Methot 2004; Thorson and Ward 2014).

Spatial and spatiotemporal variation was included in the encounter probability model and spatial variation was included in the positive catch rate model. The variance of the spa-tiotemporal effect was estimated to be less than 0.01 for the positive catch rate model and was therefore not included in the final model. Spatial and spatiotemporal variation was included in the encounter probability and the positive catch rate model. Spatial variation was approximated using 500 knots, where more knots led to non-estimable standard errors because the positive encounters are too sparse to support the dense spatiotemporal structure.

Length bins from 12 to 62 cm in 2 cm increments were used to summarize the length frequency of the survey catches in each year. The first length bin includes all observations less than 14 cm and the last bin includes all fish larger than 62 cm. Table XX shows the number of lengths taken by the survey. The stratification for length data expansion based on the design-based estimates is provided in Table XX.


Length compositions were separated into males and females. These length compositions were expanded to account for subsampling tows, with expansion based upon the stratification by depth and latitude. The stratifications for length data expansions are provided in *Table XX.

Age distributions included bins from age 1 to age 17, with the last bin including all fish of greater age. Table XX shows the number of ages taken by the survey.Age distributions were included in the model as conditional-age-at-length observations. The marginal \Gls{s-wcgbt} age-compositions were also included, but only for easier viewing of strong cohorts. The conditional-age-at-length data were not expanded and were binned according to length, age, sex, and year.

The input sample sizes for length and marginal age-composition data for all fishery-independent surveys were calculated based on Stewart and Hamel (*2014) as: 

\begin{centering}

$\text{Input N}_{y} = (0.138*(\sum_{}^{N} \text{fish}_{y} / \sum_{}^{N} \text{tows}_{y}) + 1)*\sum_{}^{N} \text{tows}_y$ 

\end{centering}

where fish is the number of `r spp` by year $y$ and $N$ the total number of tows by year.  

The input sample size of conditional-age-at-length data was set at the number of fish at each length by sex and by year.
