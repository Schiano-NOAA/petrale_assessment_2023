The base model estimate of biomass time series is similar to previous assessments (Figure \ref{fig:smry-bio-historical}), with estimated biomass of ages 3 and older estimated around `r smry_equ` mt in the unfished equilibrium, declining to a minimum of `r smry_min` mt in `r smry_minyr`, rebuilding quickly to a recent peak of `r smry_max_recent` mt in `r smry_maxyr_recent` due to 3 years of very high recruitments from 2006 to 2008, and then declining to `r smry_2023` mt in 2023 due to low or average recruitment in the years since.

In terms of fraction of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl}), the minimum was `r Bratio_min` in `r Bratio_minyr`, the recent peak was `r Bratio_max_recent` in `r Bratio_maxyr_recent` and the 2023 estimate is `r Bratio_2023`.

### Parameter Estimates
Estimated and fixed parameter values are shown in Tables \ref{tab:table-pars-base-1}-\ref{tab:table-pars-base-13}.

Estimates of key parameters include 
female $M$ = 
`r round(model$parameters["NatM_uniform_Fem_GP_1", "Value"], 3)`, 
male $M$ = 
`r round(model$parameters["NatM_uniform_Mal_GP_1", "Value"], 3)`. 
Females were estimated as growing larger than males with female length at age 17
(the second reference age) equal to 
`r round(model$parameters["L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1", "Value"], 1)` cm compared to
`r round(model$parameters["L_at_Amax_Mal_GP_1", "Value"], 1)` cm for males.
The $L_\infty$ associated with the estimated growth parameters was 
`r round(model$Growth_Parameters$Linf[1], 1)` cm for females and
`r round(model$Growth_Parameters$Linf[2], 1)` cm for males.

### Fits to the Data
The model fits the \Gls{s-wcgbt} index very well, including a decline from 2005 to 2009 followed by a rapid increase to a plateau in 2013-2017 and a gradual decline to the most recent observations. The observations that fit the least well are 2018 and 2019, which were lower than the years before and after. The absence of a 2020 survey due to the COVID-19 pandemic makes it difficult to determine if those two years were just outliers or if there was some unexplained population dynamics leading to a reduction in available biomass for those years.

When an extra standard deviation parameter was estimated for the \Gls{s-wcgbt}, the value was minimal, indicating that the index fits well enough to not require additional tuning.
