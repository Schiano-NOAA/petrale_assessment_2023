## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty
The model estimated uncertainty around the `r endyr+1` spawning output for is $\sigma$ = `r round(mod_base$Pstar_sigma, 2)`. The uncertainty around the OFL is $\sigma$ = `r round(mod_base$OFL_sigma, 2)`. These values are lower than for many west coast groundfish stocks for several reasons: large sample sizes of length and age data from fisheries and surveys, high frequency of occurrence in the \Gls{s-wcgbt} thanks to petrale primarily residing in trawlable habitate within the scope of the survey, and strong contrast in the data caused by fishing down the stock to a low level followed by rapid rebuilding. Nevertheless, these $\sigma$ values surely underestimate the overall uncertainty as they do not incorporate the model structural uncertainty and do not account for any time-varying dynamics other than recruitment.

The estimated uncertainty values are lower than the Category 1 default $\sigma = 0.5$, so all projections will use the default $\sigma$.
