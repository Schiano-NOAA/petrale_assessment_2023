## Model Structure and Assumptions

### Model Changes from the Last Assessment

The last update assessment of Petrale sole was conducted in 2019. The 2019 assessment model was the starting point for this assessment, and a bridging analysis was done to investigate the impact of increment changes to the assessment model. For this assessment, we retained a number of features of the 2019 assessment and also included a number of improvements related to use of data and modeling techniques.  Below, we describe the most important changes made since the last full assessment and provide rationale for each change:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Upgraded to Stock Synthesis version 3.30.21 (released in February 2023). This is standard practice to capitalize on newly developed features and corrections to older versions as well as improvements in computational efficiency.  Model results were nearly identical before and after this change. 

\item Updated historical and current fishery removals, to include most up to date information.

\item Removed fishery CPUE time series. 

\item Combined Winter and Summer fleets into corresponding annual North and South fleets. The separation of North and South fleets into the Winter and Summer fleets were primarily motivated by the using the fishery CPUE indices form Winter fisheries. With removal of CPUE indices from the model, separation into Winter and Summer fleets was no longer needed. Also, selectivity curves estimated for Winter and Summer fleets were very similar for both North and South fleets, and initial explorations of mirroring selectivities of Winter and Summer fleets yielded identical results with model with separate selelctivity curves in Winter and Summer fleets estimated. Combining Winter and Summer fleets within North and South fleets removed uncertainty associated with separating annual catches by season (Winter fleet was defined as November of previous year through the February of the current year), since only limited records of landings by month is available in the pre-PacFIN period. Finally, using annual catches (and not assigning to current year catches from previous) puts assessment in alignment with management system, which operated on a calendar year basis.  

\item Recalculated survey abundance indices using sdmTMB geostatistical model.

\item Used a single triennial survey time series (instead separating it into early and late indices). The triennial index was separated in the past assessment dues to change in depth and latitudinal coverage of the triennial survey. Using a single index did not impact model results, but provided a longer historical time series and simplified the structure of the assessment model.

\item Updated input sample sizes using a combination of number of trips and number and fish (rather than number of trips, as in orevious assessment), to follow current best practices.

\item Updated maturity and fecundity parameters, to include most up to date information.

\item Fixed spawner-recruit steepness at 0.8, mean of the Myers prior developed based on meta-analysis of flatfish steepness (Myers et al. 1999). Steepness likelihood profile is included in this report.

\item Excluded historical surface read ages.


\end{enumerate}

The list above documents only the most important changes made to this assessment relative to the previous one. Despite the large number of changes made to data sources and the model configuration, the results of this assessment are consistent with those done previously. 

### Modeling Platform and Structure
General model specifications (e.g., executable version, model structure, definition of fleets and areas)


### Model Parameters
The estimated parameters are summarized in table \ref{tab:par-summary} and all estimated and fixed parameters are shown in Tables \ref{tab:table-pars-base-1}-\ref{tab:table-pars-base-16}. The total number of parameters is reduced from 304 in 2019 to 267 dur to the simplification of the fleet structure into an annual model without separate selectivity for winter and summer. There are 190 estimated recruitment deviations parameters which are divided as follows: 31 parameters set up the initial age structure in 1876, 147 parameters for the recdevs in 1876 to 2022, and 12 forecast recruitment parameters for the years 2023 to 2035. The recevs in the time series are divided into early, main, and late deviations with the main period covering the years 1959 to 2020. However, the distinction between these periods in Stock Synthesis is only relevant if the main period is a zero-centered vector, which it is not in the base model. Sensitivity analyses are used to explore the impact of relaxing the zero-centering and including all recruitment deviations in the main period.
