### \acrlong{s-tri}

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the \gls{afsc} in 1977, and the survey continued until 2004 [@weinberg_2001_2002].
Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across the continential shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated.
The survey design changed slightly over time.
In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall.
The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September.
The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September.
The 1992 survey was conducted from mid July through early October.
The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August.
The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August.
Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m.
Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the data from 1977 were omitted from this analysis.
The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the US West Coast south to 36.8\textdegree N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m.
The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to 34.5\textdegree N (near Point Conception).
From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and surveyed south to 34.5\textdegree N.
In 2004, the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years.

The \gls{s-tri} commonly encounters `r spp` along the U.S West Coast (Figure \ref{fig:tri_map}). The catch-per-unit-effort estimated from the survey is roughly constant across the surveyed latitudes (Figure \ref{fig:tri_cpue_lat}). Additionally, `r spp` were captured across the survey depths between 55-500 m (Figure \ref{fig:tri_cpue_depth}). The observed lengths captured across depths by each survey period are shown in Figure \ref{fig:tri_size_depth}.

INDEX INFORMATION TO BE ADDED

Length bins from 12 to 62 cm in 2 cm increments were used to summarize the length frequency of the survey catches in each year. Table \ref{tab:Triennial_Lengths} shows the number of lengths taken by the survey. The length frequency distributions for the \gls{s-tri} from 1980-2004 are shown in Figures \ref{fig:tri_early_len_freq} and \ref{fig:tri_late_len_freq}. The stratifications for length data expansions are provided in Tables \ref{tab:strata_tri_early} and \ref{tab:strata_tri_late}.

There are no `r spp` age data from the \gls{s-tri}.  

The input sample sizes for length data were calculated using the same approach for the \Gls{s-wcgbt} data described in the [NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey Section](#nwfsc_survey).
