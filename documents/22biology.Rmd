### Natural Mortality

The instantaneous rate of natural mortality for a wild fish population is notoriously difficult to estimate. One accepted method is to examine the age distribution of an unexploited or lightly exploited stock. This method cannot readily be applied to Petrale given the long history of exploitation off the U.S. West Coast. Ketchen and Forrester [-@ketchen_population_1966] estimated that the natural mortality coefficients were 0.18-0.26 yr^-1^ for males and 0.19-0.21 yr^-1^ for females based on a catch curve analysis of 1943-1945 Washington trawl data from Swiftsure Bank, off the southwest corner of Vancouver Island. However, Petrale catches were relatively high during mid-1940s through the 1950s. Starr and Fargo [-@starr_petrale_2004] estimated the instantaneous rate of natural mortality ($M$) using Hoenig's method [@hoenig_empirical_1983] estimating $M$ values of 0.22 and 0.15 yr^-1^ were estimated given maximum ages of 20 and 30 years, respectively.   

An archived set of commercial samples, collected from Northern California between the late 1950s and early 1980s, recently found that multiple samples were aged between 20-31 years old, suggesting a similar range of $M$ values for U.S. West Coast `r spp`. U.S. stock assessments prior to 2009 and current British Columbia stock assessments assumed a value of $M$ = 0.2 yr^-1^ for both sexes. The 2013 stock assessment used a meta-analysis value produced the following normal prior distributions for females (mean = 0.151, sd = 0.16) and males (0.206, sd = 0.218) based on early research by Owen Hamel (pers. comm.) with maximum age for females and males of 32 and 29 years, respectively.

Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] refined and published a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the $M$ rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on $M$. In that same issue of *ICES Journal of Marine Science*, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] provided an updated data set of estimates of $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator $M=4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}$. The approach of basing $M$ priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] did not consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error associated with the observed relationship of $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$. Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done. Re-evaluating the data used in Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space [@hamel_method_2015]), the point estimate for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

The above is also the median of the prior. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and SE = 0.438. 

The natural mortality prior was updated for this update assessment using the above approach (Figure \ref{fig:m_prior}). Maximum age was assumed to be 32 and 29 years for females and males, respectively, the same assumption applied in the 2013 assessment. Using the Hamel et al. approach above, the prior value for females in regular space is `r round(5.4/32, 3)` and for males is `r round(5.4/29, 3)`.

### Length-Weight Relationship {#sec-biological-data-Length-Weight-relationship}

`r load("../data/weight-length_pars.rda")`
The weight-length relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside of the 
assessment model by fitting biological data to the standard power function, 
$W = aL^b$ using the R function `PacFIN.Utilities::getWLpars()` 
(where $W$ is weight in kilograms and $L$ is fork length in centimeters). 
The function estimates the relationship on a log-log scale and then uses the 
estimated standard deviation of the observed weights around the expected value 
to calculate the median weight at each length from the resulting lognormal 
distribution.

The parameters were estimated using data from the \gls{s-wcgbt}, where 21,704 
fish collected between 2003 and 2022 had both weight and length available 
of which 57.6\% were female, 42.3\% were male, and 0.1\% were unsexed. 
The resulting relationships were
`r sprintf("$W=%1.9f * L^{%1.3f}$", fa, fb)` for females and
`r sprintf("$W=%1.9f * L^{%1.3f}$", ma, mb)` for males. 
These relationships are very similar to those used for the previous assessment 
[@wetzel_status_2019].
