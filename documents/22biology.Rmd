### Length-Weight Relationship {#sec-biological-data-Length-Weight-relationship}

`r load("../data/weight-length_pars.rda")`
The weight-length relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside of the 
assessment model by fitting biological data to the standard power function, 
$W = aL^b$ using the R function `PacFIN.Utilities::getWLpars()` 
(where $W$ is weight in kilograms and $L$ is fork length in centimeters). 
The function estimates the relationship on a log-log scale and then uses the 
estimated standard deviation of the observed weights around the expected value 
to calculate the median weight at each length from the resulting lognormal 
distribution.

The parameters were estimated using data from the \gls{s-wcgbt}, where 21,704 
fish collected between 2003 and 2022 had both weight and length available 
of which 57.6\% were female, 42.3\% were male, and 0.1\% were unsexed. 
The resulting relationships were
`r sprintf("$W=%1.9f * L^{%1.3f}$", fa, fb)` for females and
`r sprintf("$W=%1.9f * L^{%1.3f}$", ma, mb)` for males. 
These relationships are very similar to those used for the previous assessment 
[@wetzel_status_2019].
