### Natural Mortality

The instantaneous rate of natural mortality for a wild fish population is notoriously difficult to estimate. One accepted method is to examine the age distribution of an unexploited or lightly exploited stock. This method cannot readily be applied to Petrale given the long history of exploitation off the U.S. West Coast. Ketchen and Forrester [-@ketchen_population_1966] estimated that the natural mortality coefficients were 0.18-0.26 yr^-1^ for males and 0.19-0.21 yr^-1^ for females based on a catch curve analysis of 1943-1945 Washington trawl data from Swiftsure Bank, off the southwest corner of Vancouver Island. However, Petrale catches were relatively high during mid-1940s through the 1950s. Starr and Fargo [-@starr_petrale_2004] estimated the instantaneous rate of natural mortality ($M$) using Hoenig's method [@hoenig_empirical_1983] estimating $M$ values of 0.22 and 0.15 yr^-1^ were estimated given maximum ages of 20 and 30 years, respectively.   

An archived set of commercial samples, collected from Northern California between the late 1950s and early 1980s, recently found that multiple samples were aged between 20-31 years old, suggesting a similar range of $M$ values for U.S. West Coast `r spp`. U.S. stock assessments prior to 2009 and current British Columbia stock assessments assumed a value of $M$ = 0.2 yr^-1^ for both sexes. The 2013 stock assessment used a meta-analysis value produced the following normal prior distributions for females (mean = 0.151, sd = 0.16) and males (0.206, sd = 0.218) based on early research by Owen Hamel (pers. comm.) with maximum age for females and males of 32 and 29 years, respectively.

Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] refined and published a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the $M$ rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on $M$. In that same issue of *ICES Journal of Marine Science*, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] provided an updated data set of estimates of $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator $M=4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}$. The approach of basing $M$ priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] did not consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error associated with the observed relationship of $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$. Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done. Re-evaluating the data used in Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space [@hamel_method_2015]), the point estimate for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

The above is also the median of the prior. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and SE = 0.438. 

The natural mortality prior was updated for this update assessment using the above approach (Figure \ref{fig:m_prior}). Maximum age was assumed to be 32 and 29 years for females and males, respectively, the same assumption applied in the 2013 assessment. Using the Hamel et al. approach above, the prior value for females in regular space is `r round(5.4/32, 3)` and for males is `r round(5.4/29, 3)`.

###Length-Weight Relationship

The length-weight relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the model using all biological data available from the `r nwfsc` data consistent with method applied by the 2013 assessment. The female weight-at-length in grams was estimated at `r format(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Fem[1],2)`^ and males at `r format(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Mal[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Mal[1], 2)`^ where $L$ is length in cm (Figure \ref{fig:wt_length}).  The length-weight relationship estimates from the `r nwfsc` data were consistent with the biological observations available from the fishery data. 


###Growth (Length-at-Age)

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female `r spp`. Figure \ref{fig:length_age} shows the lengths and ages as well as predicted von Bertalanffy fits to the data from the fishery and the `r nwfsc` data. Females grow larger than males and sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values for females $L_{\infty}$ = 54 cm; $k$ = 0.16 $\text{yr}^{-1}$, and males $L_{\infty}$ = 41 cm; $k$ = 0.25 $\text{yr}^{-1}$. These values were used as starting parameter values within the base model prior to estimating each parameter for male and female `r spp`.


###Ageing Precision and Bias

Historically, `r spp` otoliths have been read by multiple ageing labs using surface and break and burn methods. In order to conduct a comprehensive estimation of ageing bias and imprecision, the 2009 assessment compiled and analyzed all of the available double-read data from the Cooperative Aging Project (CAP) and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), as well information from a bomb radiocarbon age validation study for `r spp` off the U.S. West Coast [@haltuch_status_2009, @haltuch_california_2013]. 

The 2013 stock assessment applied read method and lab specific ageing error vectors [@haltuch_status_2013]. This update assessment did not re-evaluate ageing error and applied the same approach as the 2013 stock assessment.  The ageing error vectors are shown in Tables \ref{tab:age_error1} and \ref{tab:age_error2}. For a detailed description please see the 2013 stock assessment [@haltuch_status_2013].
