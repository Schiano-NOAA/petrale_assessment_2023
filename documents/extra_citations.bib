	abstract = {Natural morality (M) is a notoriously difficult population parameter to estimate, yet it is also one of the most important measures of life history that sets, as Beverton and Holt called it, "the course of events". Stock as­ sessments that include this parameter often show great sensitivity to its value, reflecting the need to characetrize the uncertainty inherent in its estimation. Direct measurement of natural mortality is often limited to resource intensive tag-recapture studies. Indirect measures are more often used, and are built on life history theory, relating natural mortality to traits such as age, size, maturity and reproductive condition (or just assuming 0.2). The Natural Mortality Tool attempts to accumulate several empirical estimators of M into one application. Users simply input life history values to obtain estimates of natural mortality. These estimates can be taken individ­ ually or can be combined into a weighted density function that can be used to develop an M prior that integrates uncertainty across several estimates. Comparing estimators can also reveal inconsistencies in life history values that may lead to further refining of basic biological understanding. Two examples are used to demonstrate tool functionality and highlight general recommendations on implementation. Making these estimators and the development of uncertainty in estimating natural mortality more widely available hopefully supports transparent and defensible decision-making on the treatment of this important population parameter.},

	abstract = "{Marine fish populations exist in a complex environment, with oceanographic and fisheries factors affecting their dynamics. It has been shown that life history characteristics of marine fish vary in space and time. We examined spatial variability in growth of eight groundfish species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean to identify shared spatial patterns and hypothesize about common mechanisms behind them. Growth parameters were estimated in different areas over the latitudinal range of the species, and several hypotheses were tested as to how these parameters vary along the US west coast. Clear differences in spatial growth variability emerged among the species examined. Shelf species exhibit the highest growth rate between Cape Blanco and Cape Mendocino, which may, in part, be attributed to area-specific upwelling patterns in the California Current ecosystem, when nutrient-rich deep water is brought to the surface south of Cape Blanco and is uniquely distributed throughout this area, providing favourable conditions for primary productivity. Slope species showed a cline in asymptotic size (L∞), with L∞ increasing from south to north. This cline, previously attributed to fishery removals, also fits a specific case of the widely described Bergmann’s rule, and we explore specific potential ecological mechanisms behind this relationship.}",

	abstract = {The natural mortality rate M is a key parameter in estimating the productivity of a fish stock. However, it is quite difficult to estimate given its correlation with other parameters, variation in processes governing population dynamics and data acquisition, as well as other factors such as ageing error. Meta-analytical approaches relating M to other life history parameters are often used to provide an estimate and/or Bayesian prior for M. Longevity is the one of these life history parameters most directly related to M. The maximum observed or estimated age serves as a proxy for longevity in predicting, or developing a prior for, M to be used within a stock assessment or other population model. Consideration of the age data and factors that might influence its quality for determining a maximum age is important in using a meta-analytically derived relationship between maximum age and M, though these factors are not completely absent from the data used to develop that relationship. Here, we discuss these issues, propose a relationship between maximum age and M, and develop an updated prior for M based upon maximum age.}

    abstract = {Abstract This paper investigates environmental drivers of U.S. West Coast petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) recruitment as an initial step toward developing an environmental recruitment index that can inform the stock assessment in the absence of survey observations of age-0 and age-1 fish. First, a conceptual life history approach is used to generate life-stage-specific and spatio-temporally specific mechanistic hypotheses regarding oceanographic variables that likely influence survival at each life stage. Seven life history stages are considered, from female spawner condition through benthic recruitment as observed in the Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (age-2 fish). The study area encompasses the region from 40 to 48°N in the California Current Ecosystem. Hypotheses are tested using output from a regional ocean reanalysis model outputs and model selection techniques. Four oceanographic variables explained 73\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by estimates based exclusively on the spawning stock size. Recruitment deviations were (a) positively correlated with degree days during the female precondition period, (b) positively correlated with mixed-layer depth during the egg stage, (c) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the larval stage, and (d) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the benthic juvenile stage. While multiple mechanisms likely affect petrale sole recruitment at different points during their life history, the strength of the relationship is promising for stock assessment and integrated ecosystem assessment applications.},
