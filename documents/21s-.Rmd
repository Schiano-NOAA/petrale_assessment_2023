## Fishery-Independent Data

Data from two fishery-independent surveys were used in this assessment., which included one historical survey (the \gls{s-tri}) and one current survey (the \gls{s-wcgbt}). Three sources of information are produced by these surveys: indices of relative abundance, length-frequency distributions, and age-frequency distributions.
