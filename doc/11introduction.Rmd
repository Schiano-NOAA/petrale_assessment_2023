## Life History
Petrale sole spawn during the winter at several discrete deepwater sites (270-460 m) off the U.S. west coast, from November to April, with peak spawning taking place from December to February (Harry 1959; Best 1960; Gregory and Jow 1976; Castillo et al. 1993; Carison and Miller 1982; Reilly et al. 1994; Castillo 1995; Love 1996; Moser 1996a; Casillas et al. 1998).  Females spawn once each year and fecundity varies with fish size, with one large female laying as many as 1.5 million eggs (Porter, 1964). Petrale sole eggs are planktonic, ranging in size from 1.2 to 1.3 mm, and are found in deep water habitats at water temperatures of 4–10 degrees C and salinities of 25–30 ppt (Best 1960; Ketchen and Forrester, 1966; Alderdice and Forrester 1971; Gregory and Jow 1976). The duration of the egg stage can range from approximately 6 to 14 days (Alderdice and Forrester 1971; Hart 1973; Love 1996, Casillas et al. 1998). The most favorable conditions for egg incubation and larval growth are 6–7 degrees C and 27.5–29.5 ppt (Ketchen and Forrester, 1966; Alderdice and Forrester, 1971; Castillo et al., 1995). Predators of petrale sole eggs include planktonic invertebrates and pelagic fishes (Casillas et al. 1998). 

Petrale sole larvae are planktonic, ranging in size from approximately 3 to 20 mm, and are found up to 150 km offshore foraging upon copepod eggs and nauplii (Hart 1973; Moser 1996a; MBS Appl. Env. Sci 198; Casillas et al. 1998). The larval duration, including the egg stage, spans approximately 6 months with larvae settling at about 2.2 cm in length on the inner continental shelf (Pearcy 1977). Juveniles are benthic and found on sandy or sand-mud bottoms (Eschmeyer and Herald 1983; MBS Appl. Environ. Sci. 1987) and range in size from approximately 2.2 cm to the size at maturity, 50% of the population is mature at approximately 38 cm and 41 cm for males and females, respectively (Casillas et al. 1998). No specific areas have been identified as nursery grounds for juvenile petrale sole.  In the waters off British Columbia, Canada larvae are usually found in the upper 50 m far offshore, juveniles at 19–82 m and large juveniles at 25–125 m (Starr and Fargo 2004). 

Adult petrale sole achieve a maximum size of around 50 cm and 63 cm for males and females, respectively (Best 1963; Pedersen 1975). The maximum length reported for petrale sole is 70 cm (Hart 1973; Eschmeyer and Herald 1983; Love et al. 2005) while the maximum observed break and burn age is 31 years (Haltuch et al. 2013).

## Ecosystem Considerations
Petrale sole juveniles are carnivorous, foraging on annelid worms, clams, brittle star, mysids, sculpin, amphipods, and other juvenile flatfish (Ford 1965; Casillas et al. 1998; Pearsall and Fargo 2007). Predators on juvenile petrale sole include adult petrale sole as well as other larger fish (Ford 1965; Casillas et al. 1998) while adults are preyed upon by marine mammals, sharks, and larger fishes (Trumble 1995; Love 1996; Casillas et al. 1998).

One of the ambushing flatfishes, adult petrale sole have diverse diets that become more piscivorous at larger sizes (Allen et al. 2006). Adult petrale sole are found on sandy and sand-mud bottoms (Eschmeyer and Herald 1983) foraging for a variety of invertebrates including, crab, octopi, squid, euphausiids, and shrimp, as well as anchovies. hake, herring, sand lance, and other smaller rockfish and flatfish (Ford 1965; Hart 1973; Kravitz et al. 1977; Birtwell et al. 1984; Reilly et al. 1994; Love 1996; Pearsall and Fargo 2007). In Canadian waters evidence suggests that petrale sole tend to prefer herring (Pearsall and Fargo 2007). On the continental shelf petrale sole generally co-occur with English sole, rex sole, Pacific sanddab, and rock sole (Kravitz et al. 1977). 

Ecosystem factors have not been explicitly modeled in this assessment, but there are several aspects of the California current ecosystem that may impact petrale sole population dynamics and warrant further research. Castillo (1992) and Castillo et al. (1995) suggest that density-independent survival of early life stages is low and show that offshore Ekman transportation of eggs and larvae may be an important source of variation in year-class strength in the Columbia INPFC area. The effects of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on California current temperature and productivity (Mantua et al. 1997) may also contribute to non-stationary recruitment dynamics for petrale sole. The prevalence of a strong late 1990s year-class for many west coast groundfish species suggests that environmentally driven recruitment variation may be correlated among species with relatively diverse life history strategies. Although current research efforts along these lines are limited, a more explicit exploration of ecosystem processes may be possible in future petrale sole stock assessments.
