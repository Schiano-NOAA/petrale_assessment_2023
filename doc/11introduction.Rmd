## Ecosystem Considerations
Petrale sole juveniles are carnivorous, foraging on annelid worms, clams, brittle star, mysids, sculpin, amphipods, and other juvenile flatfish (Ford 1965; Casillas et al. 1998; Pearsall and Fargo 2007). Predators on juvenile petrale sole include adult petrale sole as well as other larger fish (Ford 1965; Casillas et al. 1998) while adults are preyed upon by marine mammals, sharks, and larger fishes (Trumble 1995; Love 1996; Casillas et al. 1998).

One of the ambushing flatfishes, adult petrale sole have diverse diets that become more piscivorous at larger sizes (Allen et al. 2006). Adult petrale sole are found on sandy and sand-mud bottoms (Eschmeyer and Herald 1983) foraging for a variety of invertebrates including, crab, octopi, squid, euphausiids, and shrimp, as well as anchovies. hake, herring, sand lance, and other smaller rockfish and flatfish (Ford 1965; Hart 1973; Kravitz et al. 1977; Birtwell et al. 1984; Reilly et al. 1994; Love 1996; Pearsall and Fargo 2007). In Canadian waters evidence suggests that petrale sole tend to prefer herring (Pearsall and Fargo 2007). On the continental shelf petrale sole generally co-occur with English sole, rex sole, Pacific sanddab, and rock sole (Kravitz et al. 1977). 

Ecosystem factors have not been explicitly modeled in this assessment, but there are several aspects of the California current ecosystem that may impact petrale sole population dynamics and warrant further research. Castillo (1992) and Castillo et al. (1995) suggest that density-independent survival of early life stages is low and show that offshore Ekman transportation of eggs and larvae may be an important source of variation in year-class strength in the Columbia INPFC area. The effects of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on California current temperature and productivity (Mantua et al. 1997) may also contribute to non-stationary recruitment dynamics for petrale sole. The prevalence of a strong late 1990s year-class for many west coast groundfish species suggests that environmentally driven recruitment variation may be correlated among species with relatively diverse life history strategies. Although current research efforts along these lines are limited, a more explicit exploration of ecosystem processes may be possible in future petrale sole stock assessments.
